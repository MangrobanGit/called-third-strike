Clarifications

Data
1. Intentionally sampled? e.g. detected some gaps in data, e.g. low pitch counts. Do these exclude balls in play, foul balls, etc. (strike rate seems low?)
2. Metadata available?
3. Break 
4. Angle
5. Stratified sample
6. AP, XX pitches
7. What's the purpose of the probability model? What's the threshold, 50%?
