Research
1. Intentionally sampled? e.g. detected some gaps in data, e.g. low pitch counts. Do these exclude balls in play, foul balls, etc. (strike rate seems low?)
2. Metadata available?
3. Break 
4. Angle
5. Stratified sample
6. AP, XX pitches
7. Use case?

--Add handedness to both models.
--re-review the other features.
